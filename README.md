# CS-Vis

## About
I created this tool to visualize some of the algorithms I've been learning in my classes.<br />
Most of these visualizations are inspired by those found at [csvistool.com](https://csvistool.com).<br />
I tried to make the UX here as convenient as possible, but I'd love to hear your design input;<br />
I'm not a front-end person, so I'm doing my best :).

## Tool Use
All visualization pages have the same layout. The navigation bar can be used to access any of the visualizations.<br />
Click the clock icon :clock4: next to the visualization title to see the related Big-O data.<br />
Use the `SpaceBar` in combination with `Shift` and the `ArrowKeys` to pause and step through the various animations.<br />
Press `Ctrl-Z` to undo the most recent input.

## Creator
This is something I wanted to make to learn more about these datastructures and algorithms while <br />
also learning how to use the ReactJS framework.

## Notes
This tool is still **under construction**. As such, I would love any feedback on how I can improve this tool.<br />
Feel free to suggest any new features or request entire new visualizations.

### Current To-Do List
**These are all on my list, I'm getting to them as soon as I finish things by order of importance to the tool.**
* Complete the basic visualizations of each datastructure/algorithms
* Add examples with automatic animation
* Implement checkbox for tail-pointer use on `LinkedList`s
* Refactor `Visualizer` components/sub-class components to use React functional components and hooks<br />
   Hooks and functional components are [React's](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) suggested method of development.

If you're here from my personal website, congratulations, I finally updated the project's section.
